## 🚀 How to Run

### Terminal 1 - Server:
```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/tra01/OneDrive/Desktop/socker/project
./server
```

**Expected output:**
```
=== English Learning Platform Server ===
Initializing...
Setting up logging...
Loading configuration...
Initializing database...
Creating server instance...
Initializing server on 0.0.0.0:8080...

✓ Server listening on 0.0.0.0:8080
✓ Database initialized with default accounts:
  - admin / admin123 (Admin)
  - teacher1 / teacher123 (Teacher)

Press Ctrl+C to stop the server
```

### Terminal 2 - Client:
```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/tra01/OneDrive/Desktop/socker/project
./client
```

The Qt GUI window will open.

## 🐛 Bugs Fixed

### Critical Deadlocks (Resolved):
1. **Logger deadlock**: `initialize()` was calling `log()` while holding mutex
   - Fixed by writing log entry directly
2. **Database deadlock**: `initialize()` was calling `createUser()` while holding mutex
   - Fixed by removing unnecessary mutex in initialize

### Build Issues (Resolved):
1. Removed `<json/json.h>` dependency (not needed)
2. Added `<thread>` header for sleep_for
3. Restored original UI.hpp to match UI.cpp
