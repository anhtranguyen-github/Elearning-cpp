## Implementation Details

### Key Classes and Structures

**MainWindow** - Main application window
- Uses `QStackedWidget` for screen management
- Each screen is a separate `QWidget`
- Navigation methods: `navigateToScreen(int index)`

**Screen Indices** (enum)
```cpp
SCREEN_LOGIN = 0
SCREEN_PROFILE = 1
SCREEN_DASHBOARD = 2
SCREEN_LESSON_LIST = 3
SCREEN_LESSON_VIEW = 4
SCREEN_EXERCISE = 5
SCREEN_SPEAKING = 6
SCREEN_SCORE_FEEDBACK = 7
SCREEN_GAMES = 8
SCREEN_CHAT = 9
SCREEN_TEACHER_DASHBOARD = 10
SCREEN_FEEDBACK_INBOX = 11
SCREEN_PROVIDE_FEEDBACK = 12
SCREEN_TEACHER_CHAT = 13
SCREEN_ADMIN_DASHBOARD = 14
SCREEN_GAME_CONTENT = 15
```

### Role-Based Visibility

```cpp
void showStudentScreens() {
    // Show S-1 to S-10
    // Hide teacher and admin screens
}

void showTeacherScreens() {
    // Show teacher dashboard and T-1 to T-3
    // Hide admin screens
}

void showAdminScreens() {
    // Show admin dashboard and A-1
}
```

## Benefits of New Design

1. **Better UX**: Clear navigation paths and focused screens
2. **Role Separation**: Each role sees only relevant screens
3. **Scalability**: Easy to add new screens and features
4. **Professional**: Matches modern application design patterns
5. **Spec Compliance**: Exactly matches the screen-setting.md requirements

---

## Migration Notes

### For Users:
- No more tab-based interface
- Use navigation buttons to move between screens
- Dashboard is the main hub
- Each feature has its own dedicated screen

### For Developers:
- Each screen is implemented in its own `setup*Screen()` method
- Signal/slot connections for navigation
- Shared state in `MainWindow` class
- Easy to modify individual screens without affecting others
